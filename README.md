## About me ðŸ’¼
ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Santiago LÃ³pez, an International Business student and passionate Data Analyst in training.
I specialize in transforming data into strategic insights through Python, SQL, and data visualization tools like Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Tableau (in progress).

ðŸš€ I've worked on real-world projects, from analyzing ride-sharing trends in Chicago to identifying the most profitable mobile plans for a telecom company. My skill set includes exploratory analysis, statistical testing, and storytelling with data.

Currently, Iâ€™m expanding my portfolio and applying my skills through a Data Analyst Bootcamp and hands-on work with GitHub, Excel, and Google Sheets.
ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to grow as a BI Analyst and use data to drive smarter decisions.
